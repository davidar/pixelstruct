ABOUT
PixelStruct[1] is an opensource tool for visualizing 3D scenes reconstructed
from photographs. It uses the opensource structure-from-motion system
Bundler[2], which is based on the same research as Microsoft Live Labs
Photosynth[3].

HOW TO COMPILE
PixelStruct requires the following libraries:
 - Qt4
 - OpenGL
 - CGAL
 
Once you have installed these, compile the program with:
  mkdir build/ && cd build/ && cmake .. && make && cd ..

This will create a binary called 'pixelstruct' in build/src/, which you can
either copy into your PATH, or run directly with:
  ./build/src/pixelstruct

USAGE
PixelStruct requires Bundler, which can be downloaded from [2]. First, you need
to manually run Bundler on a directory of images as described in the README.txt
file contained in the Bundler distribution. Once Bundler has completed
processing the images, the image set can be loaded into PixelStruct.

If you do not want to manually run Bundler, and would rather view a
pre-processed dataset, you have two options:
- download the small (3.6MB) Kermit example from [4], untar it, and open the
  kermit/ directory in PixelStruct
- download the very large (1.8GB) Notre Dame example from [5], unzip it, create
  a bundle/ directory inside the NotreDame/ directory, copy/move notredame.out
  to bundle/bundle.out, and open the NotreDame/ directory in PixelStruct

To view a processed dataset, launch PixelStruct as described above, and go to
"File>Open image directory". Navigate into the image directory you ran Bundler
on, and hit "Choose". The 3D point cloud will be loaded into the window, and
once the viewer has focus (you may have to click on it for this), the camera
will focus on the first image.

You can now hit your Return key to move to the next image, or use your arrow
keys to move to another image in the chosen direction. Pressing Page Up and
Page Down will attempt to move the camera closer to and further away from the
photographed object respectively.

The View menu allows you to choose between several transition modes, as
described in section 5.3 of [6].
